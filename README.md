# BiteMaven
This is a website for weekly meal planning based on ingredients provided by users. It allows for easy integration of API.
This project is focused on the front end which is why i used a local storage API. It allows fast Client side operations or functionality.
I used a mobile first responsive design(Flexbox/Grid) and custom properties of CSS() for great looks on all devices.
i developed using Javascript with no framework and the codebase is built around modular functions each dedicated to meal generation, DOM manipulation, and Local Storage management.
